				There are many ways that you can contribute to the
				BookBrainz online encyclopedia, depending on where your
				particular skills lie.

			<h2>Editing</h2>
			<p>
				If you come to BookBrainz with new information about a
				particular book, you&rsquo;ll want to edit the database.<br/>
				To do that, you&rsquo;ll first need an account, which you
				can get by&nbsp;
				<a href="/register">
					registering
				</a>. Then, you&rsquo;ll be able to add your new
				information by editing an entity.<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Please follow the&nbsp;
				<a href={styleLink}>
					BookBrainz style guidelines
				</a> when adding data.<br/> They are still a work in progress
				and should they not cover some cases, please refer to the&nbsp;
				<a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style">
					MusicBrainz ones
				</a>, adapting as necessary.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you find duplicates, instead of deleting them, please follow&nbsp;
				<a href="https://bookbrainz-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/merge/">
					this tutorial
				</a>
				&nbsp;to learn how to merge them, so that any resource pointing
				to a merged item will be redirected properly.
			</p>

			<h2>Programming</h2>
			<p>
				If you&rsquo;re someone who&rsquo;s good at using
				JavaScript, NodeJS, SQL or LESS/SASS, we&rsquo;d love to
				have your help developing BookBrainz. Take a look at our&nbsp;
				<a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development/Priorities#BookBrainz">
					 roadmap
				</a>
				&nbsp;to see if there are any issues
				or project that interests you.
				Our code is all open source and hosted&nbsp;
				<a href="https://github.com/metabrainz?q=bookbrainz">
					on GitHub

			</p>
			<h2>Community</h2>
			<p>
				No matter whether you feel like you fit in one of these
				categories, think you can contribute in a different area, or
				just want to chat, feel free to drop in and meet us on the
				MetaBrainz&nbsp;
